                Once you master the espresso shot, the real fun begins: combining it with milk and other ingredients to create the beloved classics.

Understanding these ratios is essential, whether you are a home barista or just appreciate knowing what you're ordering. This section details the fundamental ratios that make up the world's most popular coffee beverages.

            <h3>Fundamental Espresso Drink Ratios (Espresso:Milk:Foam)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Espresso (Doppio):</strong> 60ml of concentrated coffee. This is the base for everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Macchiato (Traditional):</strong> 1 part Espresso to a *tiny* dot of foamed milk (1:0.5:0). Intense coffee flavor, marked with milk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cortado/Gibraltar:</strong> Equal parts Espresso and steamed milk (1:1:0). Perfect for tasting the coffee blend without too much dilution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cappuccino:</strong> Equal parts Espresso, steamed milk, and airy, foamed milk (1:1:1). Known for its dry foam texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Latte:</strong> 1 part Espresso to 3-5 parts steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam (1:3-5:0.5). Creamiest and most popular, allowing for creative latte art.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Americano:</strong> Espresso diluted with hot water. The classic ratio is usually 1 part Espresso to 2 parts hot water (1:2).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Mastering these recipes allows for endless customization. The difference between a latte and a cappuccino might seem small, but the textural contrast created by the milk ratio is what separates these iconic drinks.
